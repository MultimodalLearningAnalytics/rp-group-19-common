British subscription site OnlyFans is failing to prevent underage users from selling and appearing in explicit videos, a BBC investigation has found.

Under-18s have used fake identification to set up accounts, and police say a 14-year-old used a grandmother's passport.

The UK's most senior police officer for child protection also says children are being "exploited" on the platform.

OnlyFans says its age verification systems go over and above regulatory requirements.

The platform has more than a million "creators" who share video clips, photos and messages directly with subscribers for a monthly fee.

In return for hosting the material, OnlyFans takes a 20% share of all payments.

Warning: Story contains adult themes and language

There is a range of content on the site but it is best known for pornography, and requires users to be over 18.

OnlyFans was a big winner during the pandemic, exploding in popularity as much of the world was housebound. The social media platform has grown nearly 10-fold since 2019, and now has more than 120 million users.

Some creators have become millionaires from their accounts, yet for most it has been a lifeline or a second income during the pandemic.

But BBC News has investigated concerns that under-18s are selling explicit videos on the site, despite it being illegal for individuals to post or share indecent images of children.
