Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said his company is planning "one of the most significant updates of Windows of the past decade," its software that powers more than 1.3 billion people's devices. Although he didn't offer details, Nadella said Microsoft plans to unveil the new version "very soon."

"I've been using it over the past several months and I'm incredibly excited about the next generation of Windows," he said.

We don't know much about the next generation of Windows software, other than Nadella's earlier promise that the company would "double down" on Windows and PCs. Rumors about the new version, code-named Cobalt, point to updates for the user interface (known as Sun Valley), meant to "reinvigorate" and modernize its look. The last time Microsoft meaningfully changed its look was with Windows 10, which was first released in 2015, following Windows 8.1. Microsoft hasn't said when its new Windows update will be released, but CNET sister site ZDNet said it's targeted for the second half of this year.
