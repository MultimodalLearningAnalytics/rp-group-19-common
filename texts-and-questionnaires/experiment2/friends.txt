When Matt LeBlanc and Matthew Perry plop down in side-by-side leather lounge chairs in Friends: The Reunion on HBO Max, it is, for a moment, as if no time has passed since their characters reclined in front of their cherished TV set all those years ago.

Yet the actors have lived lifetimes since a young Joey Tribbiani and Chandler Bing shared a New York bachelor pad on the long-running NBC comedy. And in the case of the 51-year-old Perry, who's battled addiction and spent three months in the hospital following gastrointestinal surgery, life hasn't always been funny.

"Aww, Matty, it's good to see you, man," Perry tells the affable LeBlanc, now a 53-year-old teddy bear of a guy who delivers lingering hugs to his former cast mates.

There's a genuine warmth to the exchange between the two actors, and as an old episode flashes back to them in their 20s, sitting in barcaloungers in the exact same spot, it's hard not to feel a bit melancholy. Now they're two middle-aged guys with gray hair and more lived experience, together again and looking back. It's a simple moment, tinged with a poignancy that permeates the whole special.

The highly anticipated reunion, also dubbed The One Where They Get Back Together, reunites the six lead actors on the show's original soundstage at the Warner Bros. Studio lot in Burbank, California. It's the first time LeBlanc, Perry, Jennifer Aniston, Courtney Cox, Lisa Kudrow and David Schwimmer have been together in the same room since the finale aired in 2004.
