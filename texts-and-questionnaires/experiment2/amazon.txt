Amazon has sealed an $8.45 billion deal to buy MGM, the company that owns the iconic Hollywood studio known for releasing movies in the James Bond and Rocky franchises. The deal sets a course to amp up Amazon Prime Video with new programming mined from MGM's long history and to bolster Amazon's existing original production arm, Amazon Studios.

Amazon said MGM's goldmine is the intellectual property that it can leverage for making new content -- the beloved franchises that Amazon can now tap into to make new material.

"The real financial value behind this deal is the treasure trove of IP in the deep catalog that we plan to reimagine and develop together with MGM's talented team," Mike Hopkins, Amazon's senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios, said in a release. "It's very exciting and provides so many opportunities for high-quality storytelling."
