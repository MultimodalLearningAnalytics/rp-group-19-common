President Joe Biden was filmed taking Ford's all-electric new Lightning pickup truck for what looked like a high-speed run down a stretch of pavement during a visit to Ford's Rouge factory in Dearborn, Michigan on Tuesday.

While Biden is known as a bit of a Corvette fiend, he seems to be enjoying himself behind the wheel of a vehicle with enough torque to make even a big block C2 quake in its boots. Even better, the Lightning looks quick enough that even the Secret Service was forced to scramble to keep up, in a video clip posted to Twitter by C-SPAN.

What was the presidential verdict after taking the Lightning for a spin? "This sucker's quick!" he exclaimed, adding that he'd buy one. A reporter asked how quick it was, and Biden said it did 0-60 mph in 4.3 or 4.4 seconds, looking to a Ford employee for clarification, who quickly declined to comment. The president then did a hard launch from a stop right in front of the press pool, accelerating to 80 mph.
