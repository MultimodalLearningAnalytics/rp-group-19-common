A number of UK universities are preparing to keep lectures online into the autumn term.

It raises the prospect of Covid disrupting another academic year - and will prompt more questions about fee refunds.

Students have called plans for another term of online lectures "unacceptable".

"Online teaching is in no way a substitute for in-person learning," says a petition launched by University of Leeds students.

About half of students in England have only been able to return to face-to-face teaching this week, not long before the term ends - having been taught online since Christmas.

But a growing number of universities seem to be anticipating carrying on with a mix of online and in-person teaching into the autumn term.

The University of Liverpool says it wants as "much face-to-face teaching as possible", but is expecting a blend of online and in-person.
