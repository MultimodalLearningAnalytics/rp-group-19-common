A self-driving taxi has blocked a road in Arizona after becoming confused by a lane closed off with traffic cones.

The Waymo vehicle repeatedly drove away from roadside assistance, dispatched within minutes of the car becoming stuck.

Passenger Joel Johnson documented the experience on his YouTube channel.

The Alphabet-owned company said it was an "unusual situation" and the taxi had operated safely throughout the journey.

Waymo is the first fully self-driving taxi service legally allowed to operate.

For now, it is available in the East Valley district of Phoenix only.
