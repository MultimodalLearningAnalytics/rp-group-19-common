"Ouch, Charlie bit me! That really hurt, Charlie!"

If you were online in 2007, you're likely one of the 880 million people who have seen the iconic video of Charlie biting his brother Harry's finger.

In the days when viral videos were few and far between, this one was etched into everyone's memories.

Now, the Davis-Carr family are removing their video from YouTube and auctioning it as an NFT, or non-fungible token.

The video was uploaded it to YouTube by Harry and Charlie's dad, Howard, in 2007, because he couldn't email it to their godparents in America.

The family website says the clip was filmed as "a part of catching random moments as the boys were growing up", and that it "unintentionally went viral".

The boys, who are now 17 and 15, are "soon entering adulthood" so it's the right time to "embrace the next iteration of the internet", the site adds.

"This is not the end of the beloved video, but rather a new beginning."
