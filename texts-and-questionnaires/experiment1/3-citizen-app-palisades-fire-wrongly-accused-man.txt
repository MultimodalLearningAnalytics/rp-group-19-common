The vigilante crime app Citizen falsely accused a California man of starting a wildfire, offering a $30,000 reward to track him down before retracting the post the next day, in a move that has been condemned by criminal justice experts.

The app – which gives users local crime information via police scanners and other sources – shared an alert on Saturday about an alleged arsonist behind a large brush fire that broke out in Los Angeles over the weekend.

The suspect, who is homeless, was briefly detained by officials who ultimately found there was not enough evidence to tie him to the crime, the Los Angeles fire department confirmed to the Guardian. A different suspect has since been arrested.

But that was not before the falsely accused man had his name and image widely shared. The alert sent by Citizen contained a photo and was seen by more than 861,000 people. It read: “Citizen is offering a $30,000 reward to anyone who provides information that leads to the arrest of the arson suspect.”
